## Project Title: Calculator by Vue.JS

## Description:

The idea of project was give me simple project idea to teach myself how to use Vue.JS. This calculator application is very simialr to ones found on mobilde devices. Users can input long equations and the application will calculate the expression. The application can also take answers of previous equations and add additional equations and expressions to it. For now, this is a simple application that allows users to perform basic expressions such as adding subtracting and multiplcation. In future updates, other forms of expression such as square roots, cube roots, and trigonometry functions will be added.
